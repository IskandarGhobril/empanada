## The hook
Every week, investors confidently declare what the market will do over the next six months: **bullish**, **bearish**, or **neutral**.  
These predictions shape headlines, fuel strategies, and justify billions in trades.

{% include callout.html text="<strong>But here’s the uncomfortable question:</strong> what if investors aren’t predicting the future at all — but narrating the past? Or, alternatively, are those predictions themselves a factor in the state of the market?" %}
