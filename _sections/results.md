          Retail Investor Sentiment Is Primarily Reactive
        </h4>
        <p>
          Despite asking about the future ("Where will the market be in 6 months?"),
          AAII survey respondents largely report their experience of the past.
          The peak at lag = −26 weeks matches the survey’s 6-month horizon exactly.

          <span class="label label-evidence">Evidence</span>
          The 6-Month Mirror Effect
        </h4>
        <p>
          When investors are asked to predict the future, they anchor on where the
          market has been. This reflects <strong>recency bias</strong> and
          <strong>extrapolation behavior</strong>, now quantified.

          Google Trends Outperforms Surveys
        </h4>
        <p>
          Aggregate search behavior contains more market-relevant information than
          explicit expectations surveys. The crowd’s unconscious behavior reveals
          more than conscious predictions.

  <h2>Key Findings Summary</h2>

  <div class="findings-grid reveal">
    <div class="finding-card pulse-on-hover">
      <span class="finding-number">1</span>
      <h4>Retail Investors Are Backward-Looking</h4>
      <p>The AAII survey, despite asking about the next 6 months, primarily reflects what the market did over the past 6 months. Investors extrapolate recent experience into future outlook.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="finding-card pulse-on-hover">
      <span class="finding-number">2</span>
      <h4>Correlation Is Real But Misleading</h4>
      <p>Sentiment and future returns are positively correlated (ρ ≈ 0.33), but this does not imply predictive power. The correlation exists because both reflect past market conditions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="finding-card pulse-on-hover">
      <span class="finding-number">3</span>
      <h4>Google Trends > AAII Surveys</h4>
      <p>Aggregate search behavior contains more market-relevant information than explicit surveys. Spontaneous behavior reveals more than considered opinions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="finding-card pulse-on-hover">
      <span class="finding-number">4</span>
      <h4>Market Efficiency Confirmed</h4>
      <p>By the time retail investors update their views, the information is already priced in. Professional investors and market mechanisms incorporate information faster than sentiment surveys can capture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="finding-card pulse-on-hover">
      <span class="finding-number">5</span>
      <h4>Sentiment Is Persistent But Asymmetric</h4>
      <p>Optimism is the baseline state. Bullish sentiment is more persistent than bearish. Pessimism arrives fast and fades faster than optimism.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="finding-card pulse-on-hover">
      <span class="finding-number">6</span>
      <h4>Sectors Are Not Equal</h4>
      <p>The sentiment-market relationship varies by industry. High-attention sectors may show stronger ties to retail sentiment; commodity-driven sectors less so.</p>

  <h2>The Patient's Prognosis</h2>
  
  <div class="reveal" style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    <h3 style="color: #065f46; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Market is Healthy.</h3>
    <p style="color: #047857; margin: 0; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">It turns out the patient's "support system" (retail investors) is neither toxic nor therapeutic, it's mostly just a reflection of the patient's own behavior. The Market processes information efficiently; it's the investors who need to catch up.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #2d3748; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; line-height: 1.4;">
      "The four most dangerous words in investing are: <em>this time it's different.</em>"

    </cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Our analysis suggests a corollary: <strong>"The four most common words in investor sentiment are: <em>it was like this.</em>"</strong></p>

  <p>Retail investors aren't predicting the future, they're describing the recent past and calling it a forecast. The market prices information before the crowd catches up. By the time sentiment surveys reflect a trend, the smart money has already moved on.</p>

  <p class="closing-statement" style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #2d3748;">
    The Market doesn't need to listen to investors. <strong style="color: #667eea;">It's already heard them, and moved on.</strong>
