## The Patient

Markets are often described as rational, efficient, and forward-looking.  
But anyone who has lived through a crash knows something feels… emotional.

Sudden drops. Slow recoveries. Long periods of optimism, followed by abrupt fear.

So we did what any responsible data scientists would do.

**We sent the Market to therapy.**

## The Presenting Problem

The Market does not speak directly.  
Instead, it is surrounded by people who constantly try to interpret its mood.

- Some **state their expectations explicitly**
- Others reveal their feelings indirectly
- Prices react, beliefs follow, attention spikes

The question is simple — but uncomfortable:

> **Who is influencing whom?**

## Two Competing Stories

<div class="competing-worlds">

### 🧠 Story 1 — *Beliefs Shape Reality*

Investors look ahead.  
Their expectations influence decisions.  
Capital flows turn beliefs into self-fulfilling prophecies.

**In this world, sentiment has power.**

---

### 🪞 Story 2 — *Reality Shapes Beliefs*

Markets react to shocks, fundamentals, and liquidity.  
Investors adjust their views afterward.  
Beliefs are explanations, not signals.

**In this world, sentiment is a mirror.**

</div>

Only one story can dominate in the data.

## Our Job as Therapists

We cannot interview the Market directly.  
So we observe its relationships:

- **The Inner Circle** — active investors (AAII surveys)
- **The Crowd** — public attention (Google searches)
- **The Patient** — market prices and regimes

We place all three on the same timeline and ask:

> **When something changes — who moves first?**

Scroll on. The session begins.
