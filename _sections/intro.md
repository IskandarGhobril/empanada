<h2 class="section-title">The Market Goes to Therapy</h2>

<p class="lead">
Markets are often described as rational, efficient, and forward-looking.
But anyone who has lived through a crash knows something else is going on.
</p>

<p>
Sudden drops. Slow recoveries. Long stretches of optimism followed by abrupt fear.
The market behaves less like a machine and more like a mind.
</p>

<p>
So we did what any responsible data scientists would do.
<strong>We sent the Market to therapy.</strong>
</p>

<h3>The Presenting Problem</h3>

<p>
The Market does not speak directly.
Instead, we observe it through the people around it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Inner Circle</strong> — investors who explicitly report their expectations</li>
  <li><strong>The Crowd</strong> — public attention revealed through search behavior</li>
  <li><strong>The Patient</strong> — prices, returns, and market regimes</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everyone claims to understand the market.
But a fundamental question remains unanswered:
</p>

<div class="big-question">
<strong>Who is influencing whom?</strong>

<h3>Two Competing Stories</h3>

<div class="two-worlds">

<div class="world">
<h4>🧠 Beliefs Shape Reality</h4>
<p>
Investors look ahead.
Their expectations guide decisions.
Capital flows turn beliefs into self-fulfilling prophecies.
</p>
<p><em>In this world, sentiment has power.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="world">
<h4>🪞 Reality Shapes Beliefs</h4>
<p>
Markets move because of shocks, fundamentals, and constraints.
Investors update their views afterward.
Beliefs explain what already happened.
</p>
<p><em>In this world, sentiment is a mirror.</em></p>
</div>

</div>

<p class="transition">
Only one of these stories can dominate in the data.
Let’s begin the session.
