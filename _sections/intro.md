## Introduction

Financial markets are often described as forward-looking. Every week, investors confidently state what they believe the market will do over the next six months: **bullish**, **bearish**, or **neutral**. These expectations shape headlines, influence portfolio decisions, and justify billions in capital flows. But beneath this apparent foresight lies a deeper and rarely examined question: **who is actually leading whom?** Do investors’ predictions *pull* the market in a certain direction? or are they largely reactions to market movements that have already begun? Financial markets feel like a collective mind yet it's unclear who is leading the dance.



## Two Competing Stories

<p class="section-intro">There are two radically different worlds hiding in the data:</p>

<div class="competing-worlds">
  <div class="world-card world-1">
    <div class="world-header">
      <span class="world-icon">🔮</span>
      <h3>World 1 — Beliefs Create Reality</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="world-content">
      <p>Investors look ahead.<br>
      Their expectations influence today's decisions.<br>
      Capital flows turn forecasts into self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
      <p class="world-conclusion"><strong>In this world, sentiment is power.</strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="world-card world-2">
    <div class="world-header">
      <span class="world-icon">🪞</span>
      <h3>World 2 — Reality Creates Beliefs</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="world-content">
      <p>Markets react to fundamentals, shocks, and liquidity.<br>
      Investors adjust their outlook afterward.<br>
      Predictions are rationalizations, not signals.</p>
      <p class="world-conclusion"><strong>In this world, sentiment is a mirror.</strong></p>
    </div>

</div>

<p class="conclusion-text">Only one of these worlds can dominate and the data reveals which one.</p>

### Our Investigation

This project investigates the temporal relationship between investor sentiment and market regimes by placing beliefs and prices on the same timeline. We combine three complementary datasets:

<div class="data-sources">
  <div class="data-card">
    <h4>📊 NASDAQ Market Data</h4>
    <p><strong>24.2M data points</strong> tracking objective price movements and returns across 5,884 tickers</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="data-card">
    <h4>📈 AAII Sentiment Survey</h4>
    <p>Weekly six-month forecasts from <strong>thousands of retail investors</strong></p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="data-card">
    <h4>🔍 Google Trends Data</h4>
    <p>Revealed attention patterns for economic terms (recession, unemployment, stock market)</p>
  </div>
</div>

By tracking these signals through bull, neutral, and bear regimes, we aim to answer one fundamental question: **who moves first?**

Other than chasing prediction accuracy, we focus on something as revealing: **timing**. When do beliefs change relative to market regimes? When does sentiment lead, and when does it lag?
