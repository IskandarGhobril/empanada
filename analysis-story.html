<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>What came first, the chicken or the egg?</em></p>
<p>Financial markets are often described as forward-looking. Every week, investors confidently state what they believe the market will do over the next six months: <strong>bullish</strong>, <strong>bearish</strong>, or <strong>neutral</strong>. These expectations shape headlines, influence portfolio decisions, and justify billions in capital flows. But beneath this apparent foresight lies a deeper and rarely examined question: <strong>who is actually leading whom?</strong> Do investors’ predictions pull the market in a certain direction? or are they largely reactions to market movements that have already begun? Financial markets feel like a collective mind yet its unclear who is leading the dance.</p>
<p>This project dives into that tension by placing beliefs and prices on the same timeline. Using NASDAQ stock and ETF data alongside six-month investor sentiment forecasts, we follow the market and its expectations through bull, neutral, and bear regimes to see <strong>who moves first</strong>. Other than chasing prediction accuracy, we focus on something as revealing: <strong>timing</strong>. When do beliefs change relative to market regimes? When does sentiment lead, and when does it lag?</p>

<section id="the-dataset-5884-nasdaq-tickers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dataset-5884-nasdaq-tickers">The Dataset: 5,884 NASDAQ Tickers</h3>
<p>Our core dataset contains <strong>historical daily stock and ETF prices</strong> for all tickers currently trading on the NASDAQ. Each ticker has its own time series ending in April 2020, giving us a comprehensive view of market behavior across various economic conditions.</p>
<section id="distribution-of-trading-histories" class="level4">

<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_01.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Ticker Row Count Distribution"> <em>Figure 1: Distribution of historical data points across all NASDAQ tickers</em></p>
<p>The dataset includes <strong>5,884 tickers</strong> with an average of approximately <strong>4,112 rows each</strong> (≈24.2M total rows). The distribution is <strong>right-skewed</strong>, showing many tickers with short trading histories and a small number of established companies with decades of data.</p>
<p>This heterogeneity is crucial: newer companies may exhibit different volatility patterns than established blue-chips, and survivorship bias could affect our conclusions.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-quality-finding-the-signal-in-the-noise">Data Quality: Finding the Signal in the Noise</h3>
<p>Before any analysis, we must confront reality: <strong>financial data is messy</strong>. Our initial exploration revealed several systematic issues:</p>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_03.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Data Quality Before Cleaning"> <em>Figure 2: Price range anomalies in raw data—notice the extreme outliers</em></p>
<p>We discovered: - <strong>Negative prices</strong>: Financially impossible, indicating corrupted data - <strong>Extreme outliers</strong>: Prices reaching billions of dollars (likely decimal errors or stock splits not properly adjusted) - <strong>Missing values</strong>: Gaps in trading history</p>
<p>After rigorous cleaning protocols:</p>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_04.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Data Quality After Cleaning"> <em>Figure 3: Price ranges after cleaning—now within reasonable market bounds</em></p>
<p>The cleaned dataset shows prices within economically plausible ranges, allowing us to proceed with confidence.</p>

<section id="building-the-market-return-index" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-the-market-return-index">Building the Market Return Index</h3>
<p>We construct a unified market return by aggregating all ticker returns into a single daily time series. This gives us a comprehensive view of NASDAQ market behavior:</p>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_06.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Market Index Over Time"> <em>Figure 4: Cumulative market return index showing the overall trajectory of the NASDAQ market</em></p>
<p>The cumulative return plot reveals the market’s journey through bull runs, corrections, and the infamous dot-com crash—each regime telling its own story about investor behavior and market dynamics.</p>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_07.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Daily Returns Distribution"> <em>Figure 5: Distribution of daily market returns—approximately normal with fat tails</em></p>
<p>The daily returns show a distribution centered near zero with <strong>fat tails</strong>, characteristic of financial markets. These tail events—the extreme movements—are precisely where investor sentiment might matter most.</p>

<section id="the-sentiment-dataset-what-investors-predict" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sentiment-dataset-what-investors-predict">The Sentiment Dataset: What Investors Predict</h3>
<p>Alongside market data, we analyze the <strong>AAII Investor Sentiment Survey</strong>, where thousands of investors report their expectations for the market over the next <strong>six months</strong>. Each week, they classify themselves as: - <strong>Bullish</strong> 🟢: Expecting market gains - <strong>Neutral</strong> 🟡: Uncertain or expecting flat movement<br>
- <strong>Bearish</strong> 🔴: Expecting market declines</p>
<p>This forward-looking nature is key: we’re not asking what investors think <em>now</em>, but what they <em>predict will happen</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-sentiment-distributes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-sentiment-distributes">How Sentiment Distributes</h3>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_08.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Sentiment Distributions"> <em>Figure 6: Distribution of bullish, neutral, and bearish sentiment over time</em></p>
<p>Three distinct patterns emerge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Bullish sentiment</strong>: Centers around 30-40%, approximately symmetric. Investors maintain baseline optimism that fluctuates predictably.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neutral sentiment</strong>: The widest spread (20-50%), showing high variability. Uncertainty dominates during transitional periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bearish sentiment</strong>: Tightly clustered around 25-30% with a long right tail. Fear tends to be episodic—rare but intense spikes during crises.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_09.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Box and Violin Plots"> <em>Figure 7: Detailed view of sentiment distributions revealing asymmetries</em></p>
<p>The violin plots reveal that <strong>bearish sentiment has the longest tail</strong>—when investors turn pessimistic, they can become <em>extremely</em> pessimistic. This asymmetry suggests different psychological mechanisms for optimism and fear.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-optimism-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-optimism-bias">The Optimism Bias</h3>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_10.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Sentiment Proportions"> <em>Figure 8: Overall distribution of sentiment states across the entire dataset</em></p>
<p><strong>Bullish sentiment dominates</strong>, representing the largest share of investor expectations. This reveals a fundamental truth: <strong>investors are structurally optimistic</strong> about market growth over six-month horizons.</p>
<p>But is this optimism justified? Or does it reflect behavioral bias?</p>

<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_11.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Sentiment State Transitions"> <em>Figure 9: Transition matrix showing how sentiment changes week-to-week</em></p>
<p>The transition matrix reveals <strong>strong persistence</strong>: - Bullish investors tend to <strong>stay bullish</strong> (high diagonal values) - Neutral sentiment shows the <strong>least stability</strong>—it’s a transitional state - Bearish sentiment, once established, tends to <strong>linger</strong></p>
<p>This persistence suggests sentiment has <strong>momentum</strong>—but is that momentum leading the market or following it?</p>
</section>
<section id="sudden-sentiment-shocks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sudden-sentiment-shocks">Sudden Sentiment Shocks</h3>
<p>Not all transitions are gradual. Some weeks witness dramatic shifts:</p>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_12.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Top Sudden Changes"> <em>Figure 10: The most dramatic weekly sentiment shifts in the dataset</em></p>
<p>These spikes correspond to: - <strong>Market crashes</strong> (immediate fear response) - <strong>Policy announcements</strong> (Fed decisions, fiscal stimulus) - <strong>Geopolitical events</strong> (trade wars, conflicts)</p>
<p>The question becomes: Do these sentiment shifts <em>precede</em> market moves, or are they <em>reactions</em> to moves that already happened?</p>

<section id="clustering-with-gaussian-mixture-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-with-gaussian-mixture-models">Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models</h3>
<p>To test whether sentiment <strong>leads</strong> or <strong>follows</strong> markets, we need an objective classification of market states. We use a <strong>Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)</strong> to cluster weekly market behavior into three regimes based on returns and volatility.</p>
<p>Why GMM instead of k-means? Because markets don’t have hard boundaries—they exist in <strong>probabilistic states</strong>.</p>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_13.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Market Returns by Regime"> <em>Figure 11: Weekly market returns colored by GMM-assigned regime (Bullish/Neutral/Bearish)</em></p>
<p>The time series reveals clear regime shifts: - <strong>Green (Bullish)</strong>: Sustained periods of positive returns - <strong>Yellow (Neutral)</strong>: Mixed performance, low volatility - <strong>Red (Bearish)</strong>: Negative returns, often with increased volatility</p>
<p>These regimes emerge <strong>purely from market data</strong>—no sentiment information was used in clustering. This gives us an unbiased baseline to test sentiment’s predictive power.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-5-google-trendsthe-wisdom-of-the-crowd">🔍 Part 5: Google Trends—The Wisdom of the Crowd</h2>
<p>Beyond survey data, we analyze what millions of people are <strong>actually searching for</strong> online. Google Trends captures revealed attention: when people search for “recession,” they’re not just answering a survey—they’re seeking information driven by genuine concern.</p>
<section id="the-search-landscape" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-search-landscape">The Search Landscape</h3>
<p><img src=".\assets/plots/plot_14.png" class="img-fluid" alt="All Google Trends Queries"> <em>Figure 12: Normalized search interest for finance-related terms over time</em></p>
<p>We track searches across multiple economic dimensions: - <strong>Bearish indicators</strong>: Recession, Unemployment, Inflation - <strong>Bullish indicators</strong>: Investment, Stock market, ETF - <strong>Neutral indicators</strong>: Federal Reserve, Economic growth</p>
<p>Each query tells a story about public attention and concern.</p>

<p>Search behavior reveals <strong>macro sentiment cycles</strong>: - <strong>Pre-2008</strong>: Bullish searches dominate - <strong>2008-2010</strong>: Dramatic shift to bearish (recession searches spike) - <strong>2010-2020</strong>: Gradual return to neutral/bullish - <strong>2020</strong>: Another bearish spike (COVID-19)</p>
<p>These shifts happen at <strong>inflection points</strong>—but the critical question remains: <strong>before or after</strong> market moves?</p>

<p><strong>Intra-sentiment correlations</strong> (left): - Bearish queries strongly correlate with each other (recession ↔︎ unemployment) - Bullish queries show moderate correlation - People searching for bad news tend to search for <em>all</em> bad news</p>
<p><strong>Inter-sentiment correlations</strong> (right): - <strong>Negative correlation between bearish and bullish searches</strong> - When recession searches rise, investment searches fall - This inverse relationship validates our sentiment classification</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-central-analysis-who-moves-first">🎯 The Central Analysis: Who Moves First?</h2>
<p>Now we arrive at the core question. We have three datasets:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Market regimes</strong> (objectively clustered from returns/volatility)</li>
<li><strong>Survey sentiment</strong> (investor predictions about 6 months ahead)</li>
<li><strong>Search sentiment</strong> (revealed public attention)</li>
</ol>
<section id="two-competing-hypotheses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-competing-hypotheses">Two Competing Hypotheses</h3>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1: Sentiment Leads Markets</strong> 🔮 - Investors sense regime changes before they fully manifest - Bullish sentiment rises <em>before</em> bullish regimes - Bearish searches spike <em>before</em> market crashes - Sentiment is a <strong>leading indicator</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 2: Sentiment Follows Markets</strong> 🪞 - Investors rationalize what already happened - Sentiment shifts <em>after</em> regime transitions - Searches respond to realized volatility - Sentiment is a <strong>lagging indicator</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="the-test-lag-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-test-lag-analysis">The Test: Lag Analysis</h3>
<p>We compute cross-correlations between sentiment measures and market regimes at various time lags:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Negative lag</strong>: Sentiment precedes market (predictive)</li>
<li><strong>Zero lag</strong>: Contemporaneous relationship</li>
<li><strong>Positive lag</strong>: Sentiment follows market (reactive)</li>

<section id="key-insights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-insights">💡 Key Insights</h2>
<p>From our comprehensive analysis, several patterns emerge:</p>
<section id="structural-optimism" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structural-optimism">1. <strong>Structural Optimism</strong></h3>
<p>Investors exhibit persistent bullish bias. Even after corrections, bullish sentiment rebounds quickly. This could reflect: - Rational long-term growth expectations - Behavioral overconfidence - Survivorship bias (pessimists exit the survey)</p>
</section>
<section id="asymmetric-fear" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="asymmetric-fear">2. <strong>Asymmetric Fear</strong></h3>
<p>Bearish sentiment shows distinct characteristics: - <strong>Episodic</strong>: Rare but intense spikes - <strong>Persistent</strong>: Once established, hard to shake - <strong>Fat-tailed</strong>: Extreme pessimism more common than extreme optimism</p>
<p>This asymmetry aligns with <strong>prospect theory</strong>: losses loom larger than gains.</p>
</section>
<section id="sentiment-momentum" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sentiment-momentum">3. <strong>Sentiment Momentum</strong></h3>
<p>Strong state persistence suggests sentiment has its own dynamics. Once investors commit to a view, they maintain it for weeks. This creates: - <strong>Herding potential</strong>: Sentiment cascades - <strong>Regime stickiness</strong>: Markets can remain “irrationally” bullish or bearish - <strong>Reversal opportunities</strong>: Extremes don’t last</p>
</section>
<section id="the-search-survey-gap" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-search-survey-gap">4. <strong>The Search-Survey Gap</strong></h3>
<p>Google Trends and AAII surveys sometimes diverge: - Surveys measure <strong>stated beliefs</strong> (what investors claim to think) - Searches measure <strong>revealed concerns</strong> (what they actually worry about)</p>
<p>When these align, signals strengthen. When they diverge, it suggests <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>.</p>

<section id="the-verdict" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-verdict">🎬 The Verdict</h2>
<p>Markets don’t just move—<strong>they tell stories</strong>.</p>
<p>Through three complementary lenses (market data, sentiment surveys, and search behavior), we’ve mapped the relationship between belief and reality in financial markets.</p>
<p>The question of whether investors are <strong>authors</strong> or <strong>commentators</strong> of market narratives doesn’t have a simple answer. Our evidence suggests:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Investors are both—but the balance shifts with context.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During stable periods, sentiment may provide weak leading signals. During shocks, it largely reacts. The wisdom of crowds exists, but it’s noisy, biased, and context-dependent.</p>
<p>What remains clear: <strong>understanding this dynamic reshapes how we interpret market forecasts, financial news, and our own confidence in “knowing what comes next.”</strong></p>
<p>The data has spoken. Now, it’s up to us to listen.</p>
