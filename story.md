## Two Competing Stories

There are two radically different worlds hiding in the data.

### **World 1 — Beliefs Create Reality**
- Investors look ahead.
- Expectations influence today’s decisions.
- Capital flows turn forecasts into self-fulfilling prophecies.

In this world, **sentiment is power**.

### **World 2 — Reality Creates Beliefs**
- Markets react to fundamentals, shocks, and liquidity.
- Investors adjust their outlook afterward.
- Predictions are rationalizations, not signals.

In this world, **sentiment is a mirror**.

Only one of these worlds can dominate —  
and the data reveals which one.

## How Do Investors Feel, on Average?

To understand whether investors lead markets or follow them, we first need
to understand **how investor sentiment behaves on its own**.

We use **weekly AAII survey data**, where investors classify their six-month
market outlook as **Bullish**, **Neutral**, or **Bearish**.

Before looking at what investors actually believe, take a moment to answer
the same question they face every week:

> **Where do you think the market is headed over the next six months?**

<div class="prediction-buttons">
<button>Bullish</button>
<button>Neutral</button>
<button>Bearish</button>
</div>

Whatever your choice, you’ve just joined millions of investors who make
this call regularly.

What matters is not just *whether they are right*, but **which answer people
tend to give most often**.

## A Market That Leans Optimistic

Across decades of survey data, a clear pattern emerges:
**investors are more optimistic than pessimistic**.

### 📊 Sentiment Composition (Pie Chart)

> **Plot goes here:**  
> Pie chart showing average share of Bullish, Neutral, Bearish sentiment  
> (Bullish ≈ 38%, Neutral ≈ 31%, Bearish ≈ 31%)

This asymmetry suggests **structural optimism**:
investors expect growth more often than decline.

## How Extreme Do Beliefs Get?

Averages hide important dynamics.  
To see how sentiment fluctuates, we examine its full distribution.

### 📊 Sentiment Distributions (Boxplots)

> **Plot goes here:**  
> Three boxplots: Bullish, Neutral, Bearish sentiment levels

Distributional plots reinforce the picture:
- Bullish sentiment has a **higher median**
- It shows **larger upside spikes**, sometimes exceeding 60%
- Bearish sentiment is typically more contained

Extreme pessimism appears in **short bursts**,  
while optimism is more persistent.

## Do Beliefs Stick?

Levels alone don’t tell the full story.  
What matters is **how sentiment changes from week to week**.

We assign each week to its **dominant sentiment state**
and construct a **transition matrix**.

### 📊 Sentiment Transition Matrix

> **Plot goes here:**  
> Heatmap showing transitions between Bullish / Neutral / Bearish states

The results show strong persistence:
- Bullish remains bullish **77%** of the time
- Neutral remains neutral **59%**
- Bearish remains bearish **64%**

However, pessimism is **less sticky** than optimism.
Bearish states are more likely to flip directly to bullish than the reverse.

This asymmetry suggests that **negative beliefs unwind faster than positive ones**.

## When Beliefs Suddenly Change

If most weeks look similar, the most revealing moments are the exceptions.

To capture these, we identify the **largest week-to-week changes**
in bullish, neutral, and bearish sentiment.

These jumps represent moments when investors rapidly reassess their outlook.

### 📊 Largest Sentiment Jumps Over Time

> **Plot goes here:**  
> Time-series highlighting largest positive and negative sentiment changes

Bar charts of the largest sentiment jumps allow us to pinpoint
**exact calendar dates** where beliefs shifted abruptly.

These dates become **critical reference points** for the rest of the analysis:
they let us compare **when beliefs move** relative to **when markets move**.

---

## Why This Matters

Sentiment is usually stable.
When it changes sharply, something important is happening.

The key question is now unavoidable:

> **Do these belief shifts lead market movements —  
> or do they follow them?**

That is where the two worlds finally collide.
