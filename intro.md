## Introduction

Financial markets are often described as forward-looking. Every week, investors confidently state what they believe the market will do over the next six months: **bullish**, **bearish**, or **neutral**. These expectations shape headlines, influence portfolio decisions, and justify billions in capital flows.
But beneath this apparent foresight lies a deeper and rarely examined question: **who is actually leading whom?**
Do investors' predictions pull the market in a certain direction? Or are they largely reactions to market movements that have already begun? Understanding this relationship has profound implications for how we interpret market forecasts, investment strategies, and our confidence in predicting financial outcomes.

This project investigates the temporal relationship between investor sentiment and market regimes by placing beliefs and prices on the same timeline. We combine three complementary datasets:
- **NASDAQ stock and ETF data** (24.2M data points): Objective price movements and returns across 5,884 tickers
- **AAII Investor Sentiment Survey**: Weekly six-month forecasts from thousands of retail investors
- **Google Trends search data**: Revealed attention patterns for economic terms (e.g., "recession", "unemployment", "stock market")

By tracking these signals through bull, neutral, and bear regimes, we aim to answer one fundamental question: **who moves first?**
Rather than chasing prediction accuracy, we focus on something more revealing: **timing**. When do beliefs change relative to market regimes? When does sentiment lead, and when does it lag?


Two Competing Stories
There are two radically different worlds hiding in the data:
World 1 — Beliefs Create Reality
Investors look ahead.
Their expectations influence today’s decisions.
Capital flows turn forecasts into self-fulfilling prophecies.
In this world, sentiment is power.
World 2 — Reality Creates Beliefs
Markets react to fundamentals, shocks, and liquidity.
Investors adjust their outlook afterward.
Predictions are rationalizations, not signals.
In this world, sentiment is a mirror.
Only one of these worlds can dominate — and the data reveals which one
