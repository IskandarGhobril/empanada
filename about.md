This website accompanies a data analysis project on the relationship between **investor expectations** and **NASDAQ market regimes**.

### Team & scope
We focus on a simple causal-style question: **who leads whom?**  
Beliefs shaping prices, or prices shaping beliefs.

### Work in progress
The analysis notebook is evolving; this site highlights the clean story-facing results.
